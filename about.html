            <h3>Why should you donate?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Donating to charity is a major mood-booster. The knowledge that you’re helping others is hugely empowering and, in turn, can make you feel happier and more fulfilled. Research has identified a link between making a donation to charity and increased activity in the area of the brain that registers pleasure – proving that as the old adage goes, it really is far better to give than to receive. </p>
            <p>Knowing someone who gives to charity can be a catalyst for giving to charity yourself. By giving to charity, you may well be helping to remind friends and family of causes they themselves are passionate about and would like to support.
 
Your charitable donations could even bring about a family-wide effort to back a charity or charities that have special significance to you as a group.

Family giving creates a bond, helping to bolster relationships through a shared goal and often raises more money than could otherwise be possible through individual donations. Chances are, many of your family members are already giving to charity, so working together could help you to make even more of a positive impact</p>
